## üé§ Why ReconTracks Exists

As a live-streaming musician, I created ReconTracks to solve a common problem: what I heard in my headphones wasn't what my audience heard in OBS.

**The Problem:**  
With a setup of Guitar/Mic ‚Üí Interface ‚Üí REAPER ‚Üí OBS (via ReaStream) and backing tracks playing through desktop audio, there was a disconnect between my monitoring mix and the audience mix. This made it impossible to reliably balance guitar, vocals, and backing tracks.

**The Solution:**  
ReconTracks brings backing tracks directly into REAPER, so you can balance guitar, vocals, and backing audio all in one place before the mix hits OBS. This gives you consistent monitoring, better control, and eliminates guesswork.
